    <section id="Family">
        <p>My parents, Emerson Baldivia and Angie Baldivia, have worked so hard to give me a good life. Things weren’t always easy, but they did their best to provide for me and make sure I had what I needed.

My mother, Angie, went abroad to work as an OFW. It wasn’t an easy choice, but she made that sacrifice so our family could have a better future. Growing up without her around all the time was hard. I missed her during birthdays, school events, and ordinary days when I just wanted to be with her. But even though she was far away, she always found ways to show her love. Her calls, messages, and gifts reminded me that she was thinking of me, and that meant everything.

My father, Emerson, stayed here and worked as a tricycle driver. His job wasn’t easy. He spent long hours on the road under the heat of the sun just to earn enough for us. He didn’t always say much, but I knew he cared. He showed his love in simple ways, like making sure I had food to eat, checking on me after school, or giving me small treats when he could.

Since both of them were working hard, my grandparents, my Nanay (Lola) and Lolo, became like second parents to me. They raised me with love, guided me, and supported me in everything I did.

Even though life wasn’t always perfect, I never felt alone. My parents' love has always been there, even from afar. One day, I hope to make them proud and give back for everything they’ve done for me.</p>

        <h2>Siblings</h2>
        <p>I’m an only child, so I never had brothers or sisters to play or argue with. Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like to have a sibling someone to share stories with, joke around with, or even fight over silly things. But I’ve gotten used to being on my own, and honestly, I enjoy the quiet and the freedom that comes with it.

Even though I don’t have siblings, I never really felt lonely. My parents, grandparents, and friends have always been there for me. They filled my life with love and support, making sure I never felt like I was missing out. I may not have a brother or sister, but I have people who treat me like family, and that’s more than enough for me.
